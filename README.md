# my-chatgpt
Maven based Spring project is using ChatGPT (it gives answer to the questions, or provides image as requested in the text)

Endpoints: 

http://localhost:8080/models

http://localhost:8080/engines

http://localhost:8080/my-chat-gpt-text

http://localhost:8080/generate-image

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or [CatGPT](https://www.cat-gpt.com/)

The result is not the same :) LOL
